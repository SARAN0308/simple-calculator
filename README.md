I created simple calculator program by using switch case and do while and here i perform operations like add,sub,mul,division
herewith i attached algorithm code for my calculator program..so that everyone can understand and write easily calculator program in java

APPROACH USED:
1) Get two numbers from scanner class..and scanner class to be imported as package.
2) In which using (swtich case and do while) to perform calculator operations such as(+,-,*,/).

ALGORITHM:
1) First import a scanner package to get input from scanner.
2) Create class name for calculator program.
3) Declare a main method without main method JVM will not execute the program.
4) Declare datetypes (float,char) and variables(a,b,choice,ch).
5) Object creation for scanner class in main method.
6) Initate Do condition in which to print statements like(+,-,*,/).
7) Then switch case is used to check the 5 cases...
8) For (case 1 to case 5)operator to perform (+,-,*,/).
9) Every case variables (a&b) values need to get values from scanner (scan.next float()).
10)Atlast check for while condition...
